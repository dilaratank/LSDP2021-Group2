Github repo for the course LSDP (UvA) group 2. 

The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging time for all of us. The rapid spread and the deadliness of the virus have led to great social and economic disruption: lockdown in multiple countries, a global recession, and the closing of public areas. Healthcare workers run overtime to manage the shortage of hospital beds and treatment of the COVID-19 virus, while not much is known about it. AI models, specialized in NLP tasks, could help process COVID-19 information in medical interviews and make it more interpretable and visible. This could be of help in getting to know the virus and advising patients what to do. This project will focus on the influence of COVID-19 in medical interviews. Three different topics, research questions, and models will be discussed to answer the question: how has COVID-19 influenced medical interviews?
